      <description>My name is George Metaxas and I am an Android Software Engineer. I have been working with Android since 2012, initially as a hobby and since mid-2014 professionally. I am currently employed at Bespot. I have been an enthusiastic, long time Linux user, with Gentoo Linux still being my distribution of choice (although lately I have also been trying out Arch Linux).
I have previously worked as a backend software engineer / devops engineer at OTE Group of companies between 2011 and 2014.</description>
