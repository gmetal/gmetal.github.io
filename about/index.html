<p>My name is George Metaxas and I am an Android Software Engineer. I have been working with Android since 2012, initially as a hobby and since mid-2014 professionally. I am currently employed at <a href="https://bespot.com/">Bespot</a>. I have been an enthusiastic, long time Linux user, with <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> still being my distribution of choice (although lately I have also been trying out <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>).</p>
<p>I have previously worked as a backend software engineer / devops engineer at <a href="https://www.cosmote.gr">OTE Group of companies</a> between 2011 and 2014. Initially, I joined an internal team that was responsible for maintaining and extending one of the organisation&rsquo;s sales capture platforms, written in Jython and Django. I was later transferred to a new internal team that was tasked with implementing a middleware layer between the company&rsquo;s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130609195736/https://www.ote.gr/web/guest">new web site</a> and the backend systems. I familiarised myself with automating manual tasks, CIs (Hudson) and automated testing.</p>
<p>In mid-2014, I started working as an Android Software Engineer at (the now defunct) <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150605201927/https://globoplc.com/">Globo PLC</a>, as part of the company&rsquo;s Android team. One of my main tasks was to integrate a native C++11 library that was implementing the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/exchange_server_protocols/ms-ashttp/4cbf28dc-2876-41c6-9d87-ba9db86cd40d">Activesync protocol</a>, into an updated version of the company&rsquo;s flagship <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150722035913/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gr.globo.citrongo.enterprise.client">product</a>. I also started fiddling around with Docker and helped in setting up the team CI through Jenkins.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 2016, I joined the mobile team at <a href="https://www.skroutz.gr">Skroutz.gr</a>, as an Android software engineer. I was focused on maintaining and extending the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niobiumlabs.android.apps.skroutz">Skroutz core application</a>. I helped in setting up and extending the Android CI procedures (in Jenkins), complete with static analysis tools, UI testing (maintaining a local farm of Android devices using <a href="https://github.com/DeviceFarmer/stf">STF</a>) and Play store deployments. Other major contributions involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>laying down the foundations for writing UI and unit tests</li>
<li>implementing various business-related features</li>
<li>refactoring internal functionalities</li>
<li>serving as team lead for a period of around 18 months</li>
</ul>
<p>In December 2020, I made a quick stop at <a href="https://www.epignosishq.com/">Epignosis</a> and joined its mobile team as an Android engineer. My primary tasks were centered in maintaining the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talentlms.android">TalentLMS</a>. I also did some part-time consulting for <a href="https://keeano.com/">Keeano</a>, where I implemented a few features in their <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keeano.app">Android application</a>. Since April 2021, I have been providing my Android experience at <a href="https://bespot.com/">Bespot</a>.</p>
